					<p class="big-text">Mechanical Engineering</p>
					<p align="justify">Mechanical engineering is a discipline of engineering that applies the principles of engineering, physics and material science for analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. The engineering field requires an understanding of core concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, material science, structural analysis and electricity. Mechanical engineers use these core principles along with tools like <i>computer aided engineering, product life cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling system, transport system, aircraft, watercraft, robotics and weapons. </i>Mechanical engineering science emerged in the 19th century as a result of development in the field of physics. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancement in technology, and mechanical engineers today are pursuing developments in such fields as composites, mechatronics and nanotechnology.</p><br>
